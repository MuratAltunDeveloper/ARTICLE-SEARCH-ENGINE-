I developed a system that automatically searches, saves and makes academic articles accessible. I collected article titles, author information and PDF files by pulling data from academic search engines based on keywords entered by users. I provided advanced search and filtering by storing the data on MongoDB and Elasticsearch. I created a backend with FastAPI and developed a Svelte-based web interface. Users can search, list and view the details of articles through this interface. Thanks to Elasticsearch, I provided flexible queries and typo correction suggestions. With this project, I aimed to provide a comprehensive search experience for researchers and students by facilitating access to academic works.
